    			    <p>The Jubilee Austen Project provided another dimension of web development skills. This website was built using a Photoshop Design comp and the design was recreated using HTML5 and CSS. Additionally the code was validated, tested for cross-browser compatibility and launched with a website domain and hosting provider through FTP. </p>

    			    <p>This project was a wonderful study in grids, block elements, inline elements, floating, fonts, and text. Here is where I developed an understanding of HTML 5 basic structure, and the power of CSS for styling the text and layout with color, different fonts, font weights, and font sizes. </p>
